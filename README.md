# Cryptmoji

Cryptmoji is a fun project to encrypt your text into Emojis, Latin and Math Symbols.
It uses *AES-256* Encryption Algorithm for *Encryption* and *Decryption* and *PBKDF2* for generating crypto key from user defined password.

This project is fully based on [Web Crypto APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) and doesn't use any external libraries for cryptography.


## Inspiration

The best way to learn something is by building it so I created this fun project as a result of learning about [Web Crypto APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API).
